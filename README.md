Project Overview:- 

Hand Gesture Recognition System using CNNs:- 
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately classify sign language letters based on image inputs. The model is trained on a dataset of grayscale images of hand gestures representing sign language letters and achieves an accuracy. The project uses techniques such as convolutional layers, max pooling, and ReLU activation functions to extract features from the images. The model is implemented using Python and TensorFlow/PyTorch and trained on Google Colab.
